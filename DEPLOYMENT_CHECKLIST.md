  ```

**Your Connection String:** ________________________________

- [ ] Project imported from GitHub
- [ ] Framework preset: Create React App
- [ ] Root directory set to `frontend`
- [ ] Build command: `npm run build`
- [ ] Output directory: `build`
- [ ] Environment variable added:
  - [ ] `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://your-backend-url/api`
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] Frontend URL copied

**Your Frontend URL:** ________________________________

---

## ðŸ”— Step 4: Connect Backend and Frontend

- [ ] Backend CORS_ORIGINS updated with frontend URL
- [ ] Backend redeployed with new CORS settings
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend

Update Railway `CORS_ORIGINS` to:
```
https://your-frontend.vercel.app,https://*.vercel.app
```

## ðŸ§ª Step 5: Testing

### Test Backend API
- [ ] Open: `https://your-backend-url/docs`

- [ ] Test email is stored with timestamp

### Test API Directly
```bash
# Subscribe test
curl -X POST "https://your-backend-url/api/subscribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test2@example.com"}'

# Get subscribers
curl "https://your-backend-url/api/subscribers"
```
